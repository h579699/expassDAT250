technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them

The purpose of this assignment was to ensure that my PC had a working Software Development Environment (SDE) installed. The requirements for the SDE was a Java Development Environment (JDK), an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the Maven software management tool and a Git client installed. In additon to this a GitHub account was needed for handing in the assignment. 

I already had several JDK versions installed on my PC, but installed a newer version JDK 18 from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/. I also installed the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers using the Eclipse Innstaller 2022-06 downloaded from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/. Downloaded Maven and added it to the PATH environment variable. 

Already had a GitHub account and a Git client and a Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) installed. 

Before following the Heroku tutorial I had to install PostgreSQL. 
Downloaded PostgreSQL
